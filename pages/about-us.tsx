              <p className="card-text">Decisions related to our health are amongst the most important that we make. Naturally,
                they are difficult decisions, and for many reasons, but partly because there are so many possible solutions
                scattered throughout the internet. Clicking through Google to find all these options is cumbersome,
                and some options would likely still be missed. We have tried to gather, in one place, all the companies
                offering online healthcare services. Each company is analyzed according to a number of parameters, such
                as price and where they offer services, and all this information is shared freely, in a convenient user interface.
                Thus, users can see all their possible options in one view, and ultimately make a wise decision about the things
                that matter most. </p>
