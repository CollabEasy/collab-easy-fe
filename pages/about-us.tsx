            <h5>Why Wondor?</h5>
            <p>When you are a content creator, the quality of your content is one of the most important things but
              so is collaborting with other artists. By collaborating, you learn from each other and at the same time
              increase your reach. <br></br><br></br>
              Today, artists are everywhere and it makes it difficult to find the right one for yourself to collaborate
              because there are so many platform artists are scattered over. Currently, there is no one place where you
              can see all of the artists from all of the platforms. We have tried to gather, in one place, all of the artists
              ready to collaborate with others. For each artists, you can see their sample work, their presence on various social
              platforms and if they are available to collaborate, and all this information is shared freely, in a convenient user
              interface. Thus, artists can see all their possible options in one view, and ultimately make a wise decision about who inspires
              them the most to collaborate with on their next big hit. </p>
